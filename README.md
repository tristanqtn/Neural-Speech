# Neural Speech - Arduino Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Neural Speech Arduino Project! This initiative aims to analyze human voice using Arduino and implement a neural network to recognize spoken words. The fusion of voice analysis and neural network training provides an exciting opportunity for creating voice recognition applications using Arduino.

## Project Goals

- **Voice Analysis:** Implement voice analysis techniques to capture and process human speech using Arduino.

- **Neural Network Training:** Train a neural network to recognize specific words based on the analyzed voice data.

## Features

- **Arduino Integration:** Leverage the capabilities of Arduino for real-time voice processing and neural network training.

- **Word Recognition:** Implement a neural network to identify and recognize specific words spoken during the voice analysis.

- **Scalability:** Design the project to be scalable for potential expansion and integration with other applications.

## How to Use

1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Connect the required components to Arduino for voice input and processing.

2. **Software Installation:**
   - Install the necessary libraries and tools on Arduino for voice analysis and neural network training.

3. **Neural Network Training:**
   - Train the neural network with sample voice data to recognize specific words.

4. **Voice Analysis:**
   - Implement voice analysis functions to capture and process incoming speech.

5. **Integration:**
   - Integrate the trained neural network with the voice analysis system for word recognition.
